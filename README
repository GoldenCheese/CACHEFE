This tool is designed for  estimating SRAM failure rate.

【Instruction】 

Currently, the tool supports modeling three kinds of SRAM Failure Rate: Read Failure, Write failure, Sense Amplifier Failure. For more details about the failure , please refer to:

[1] Mukhopadhyay S, Mahmoodi H, Roy K. Modeling of failure probability and statistical design of SRAM array for yield enhancement in nanoscaled CMOS[J]. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 2005, 24(12):1859-1880.

Basically, MOSFET failure rate is so small (10^-6) that Monte Carlo method would be costly (10^8~10^9 simulations required), So here we use algorithm described in :

【Prerequest】

Currently, the source codes request g++ to compile on Linux | Mac OSX platform.

【Install】

1. Change directory to the path where your unzipped file. (Command ---> cd "your path")
2. Compile the source code. (Command ---> make)
3. Run the programm. (Command ---> ./APA)

【Usage】

 ./APA [-a arguement] [-c argument] [-k argument]

[-a argument]: represents the algorithm used to calculate SRAM Failure Rate, the argument must be one of "APA", "APE", default is APA.

[-c argument]: represents the cell number on a sense amplifier, the argument must be a positive integer, default is 64.

[-k argument]: represents the kind of the failure,the argument must be one of "read","write","SA","All",default is "All".
