This tool "CACHEFE" is designed for estimating SRAM failure rate.

【Instruction】 

Currently, the tool supports modeling three kinds of SRAM Failure Rate: Read Failure, Write failure, Sense Amplifier Failure. For more details about the failure , please refer to:

[1] Mukhopadhyay S, Mahmoodi H, Roy K. Modeling of failure probability and statistical design of SRAM array for yield enhancement in nanoscaled CMOS[J]. IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, 2005, 24(12):1859-1880.

Basically, MOSFET failure rate is so small (10^-6) that Monte Carlo method would be costly (10^8~10^9 simulations required), So here we use algorithm described in :

【Prerequest】

Currently, the source codes request g++ to compile on Linux | Mac OSX platform.

【Install】

1. Change directory to the path where your unzipped file. (Command ---> cd "your path")
2. Compile the source code. (Command ---> make)
3. Run the programm. (Command ---> ./APA)

【Usage】

 ./APA -C (--Cell) argument [-A (--Algo) arguement]  [-T (--Type) argument]


[-C (--Cell) argument]: represents the cell number, the argument must be a positive integer and must be given.

[-A (--Algo) argument]: represents the algorithm used to calculate SRAM Failure Rate, the argument must be one of "APA", "APE", default is "APA".

[-T (--Type) argument]: represents the type of the failure,the argument must be one of"all","read","write","sa", default is "all".



【Example】

./APA --Cell 64  : Using algorithm APA to simulate  all types of failure of a SRAM with 64 Cells.

./APA -C 32 -T read : Using algorithm APA to simulate  read failure of a SRAM with 32 Cells.
